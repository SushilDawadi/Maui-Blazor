Teaching Points:

Interface = Contract: Any class implementing this MUST have all these methods
Abstraction: We define WHAT to do, not HOW to do it
Task<>: All methods are async (don't block the UI)
**User? **: The ?  means it can return null (user not found)



Why Separate IUserService and UserService
-> Defines a clear contract for user operations
-> Keeps UI independent from implementation
-> Allows easy switching (memory, database, API)
-> Makes testing simple and safe
-> Improves maintainability and scalability
